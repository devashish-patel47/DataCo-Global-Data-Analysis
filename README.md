# DataCo-Global-Data-Analysis

This repository contains the data analysis performed by our project group called Dream Five of DataCo Global's supply chain dataset. We are a group of 5 students from St. Clair college studying as post grad first year students of Data Analytics for Business.

The link for the original dataset is given below:

It contains three files: 

The first file is the source code python file where we imported the original dataset and performed exploratory data analysis to get an idea about our dataset as well as performed descriptive statistics on our dataset.

The second file is the pdf which contains the detailed proposal that we submitted to our instructor and project guide explaining what we aimed to achieve from this project as well as what are our objectives and the business questions that we will focus on.

The third file is the tableau workbook (.twb) file which contains all our final dashboards and sheets which show our visualizations.
