This repository contains three files: 

The source code python file where we imported the original dataset and performed exploratory data analysis to get an idea about our dataset as well as performed descriptive statistics on our dataset.

The pdf which contains the detailed proposal that we submitted to our instructor and project guide explaining what we aimed to achieve from this project as well as what are our objectives and the business questions that we will focus on. It also includes the detailed analysis along with our final comments and suggestions.

The tableau workbook (.twb) file which contains all our final dashboards and sheets which show our visualizations.
